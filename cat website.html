    <p>Cats, also known as Felius Catus, are small animals who are carnivorous. Normally, they are kept as pets and with the right care, live long lives. 
      Most cats are domestic shorthairs, or called tabby cats. Cats communicate with meows, purrs, hisses, growls, and trills. Depending on the cat's personality, they love toys and will need stimuli daily.
